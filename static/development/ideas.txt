#BACKGROUND INFO
I want to implement a simple website that allows users to supply feedback about the dive sites of Una Una.
Feedback in the form of ratings or upvotes/downvotes, comments, pictures and the species seen there, while
also being able to add dive specific feedback in the form of conditions, visibility, depth, dive times, etc.
Maybe also a would dive again/would not dive again rating system.


#AIM
To enable future divers of Una Una to access dive site information. To arrive at a dive centre armed with
prior knowledge of where they want to go, and be able to leave feedback once they have left or post-dive.


#IDEAS
Homepage with nav bar - keep it simple
Una Una info page
How to use site
Dive site directory page with all dive sites listed
Maybe sort by rating, alphabet
Individual dive site pages
Feedback forms
Comments
Picture adding etc etc
Top 5 sites page / Must dive page
Pristine/staff recommends page
Recent posts page showing 5 or more recent posts

### TOP SITES FUNCTION
@app.route('/top_sites')
def top_sites():
    """ Show user top sites """
    return render_template('/nav/topsites.html', top=rank_sites(), dropdown=sites_all(), top_five=top_five())
